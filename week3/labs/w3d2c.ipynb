If f(x) > f(y), we know that the minimizer cannot come before x: if it came before, then we would have f(x) <= f(y). Similarly, if we have f(x) < f(y), we know that the minimizer cannot come after y. If f(x) = f(y), then the minimizer must be in between x and y.\n",

When the range is small enough that the size no longer decreases, then we can just check all values left in the range (like we did in the `linear_minimizer` function). \n",
