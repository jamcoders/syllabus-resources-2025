While the compiler doesn't care about style, it's incredibly important because **your future self and other people will need to read your code**.\n","\n","We've covered some key conventions for good style:\n","*   **Variable names** must be in **\"snakecase\"** (all lowercase, words separated by underscores, like `num_people` or `is_raining`). They should be **descriptive** to clearly indicate what they represent, but not excessively long.\n","\n","*   You should **use comments to describe what your code does** if it's not immediately obvious from variable names and operators. Comments are also useful for **documenting any assumptions** you've made.\n","\n","*   **Indentation is crucial in Python for defining code blocks**. All lines indented immediately after a condition are part of that conditional's \"body\" and will **only be executed if the condition is true**. When lines revert to a previous indentation level, they are no longer part of that conditional's body and will execute every time. For nested conditionals, the inner block's indentation is one more level relative to its own condition statement.\n","\n","**Example:**\n","```python\n","num_students = int(input(\"How many students? \")) # This line always executes\n","\n","\n","if num_students > 100: # This is the condition\n","    print(\"Wow, more than 100!\") # This line is indented, part of the 'if' block [2]\n","    print(\"That's a lot!\")       # This line is also indented, part of the 'if' block [2]\n","\n","print(\"You said there are\", num_students, \"students.\") # This line is not indented under the 'if', so it executes every time [3]\n","\n","```\n","\n","In this example, `\"Wow, more than 100!\"` and `\"That's a lot!\"` will only print if `num_students` is greater than 100.
